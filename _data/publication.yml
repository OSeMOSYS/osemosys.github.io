- abstract: The unsustainable use of natural resources, in particular soil degradation
    and pollution, is one of the main factors contributing to the climate and biodiversity
    crisis. The European Union has outlined a new European Green Deal, whose objectives
    include increasing the overall quality of the agri-food chain in relation to environmental
    sustainability, focusing on reducing the use of pesticides and increasing the
    share of organic in overall production. A Nexus thinking perspective is applied
    to analyse this topic over a 50-year time horizon (2010–2060) for the agricultural
    system of the Basilicata Region (Southern Italy), represented by the TIMES Land-WEF,
    an optimizing, bottom-up energy-technology model, built to investigate the interactions
    and interrelations between water, energy food and land. The novelty of this modelling
    approach is the choice of land use as the guiding parameter of the optimization
    process. The main objectives of the Farm to Fork Strategy are modelled as system
    constraints and the scenario analysis allows to characterise their effects on
    the evolution of the agricultural system over the examined time. The results show
    that the pesticide reduction constraint leads to an increase in land use by organic
    crops from 24.6 % to 32.4 % in 2060. In particular, this is due to the increased
    contribution of cereal, forage, olive growing crops, permanent meadows and pastures,
    which lead to a 46 % reduction in irrigation water consumption. On the other hand,
    the reduction in inorganic fertilizers is not accompanied by a significant increase
    in organic crops, but resulted in the reduction of cereal crops.

- abstract: The increasing prevalence of wicked problems, such as climate change,
    requires a transformation in education that equips students with the skills, competencies
    and knowledge to address these complex challenges. Wicked problems are characterised
    by their incomplete, contradictory, and ever-changing requirements, rendering
    them difficult to resolve due to intricate interdependencies. Nexus thinking offers
    a valuable approach to these problems, as it emphasises the interconnectedness
    of various systems, fostering a more comprehensive understanding of the challenges
    at hand. In this paper, we propose the use of Climate, Land, Energy, and Water
    (CLEWs) modelling as an innovative pedagogical strategy tool to cultivate nexus
    thinking among students. Building upon the pioneering CLEWs pedagogical work of
    Shivakumar et al., in their ‘Introduction to CLEWs’ Open Learn course, we demonstrate
    how this approach can be utilised in a Higher Education (HE) setting in the form
    of a Masters’ module for geography students.

- abstract: This study was motivated by the high reliance on hydropower plants (HPPs)
    developed and planned along the river Nile and the fact that drought events are
    the most imminent and drastic threats to Uganda’s power production. The study
    aimed to assess HPPs’ resilience and the effectiveness of selected adaptation
    measures. The climate, land, energy, and water system (CLEWs) framework was employed
    to assess resilience amidst competing water demands and stringent environmental
    flow requirements. Under extreme dry conditions, power generation could plummet
    by 91% over the next 40 years, which translates into an annual per capita consumption
    of 19 kWh, barely sufficient to sustain a decent socioeconomic livelihood. During
    arid conditions, climate models predicted an increase in streamflow with increasing
    radiative forcing. Restricting the ecological flow to 150 m3/s could improve generation
    by 207%. In addition, if planned power plants were to be built 5 years ahead of
    schedule, the normalized mean annual plant production could increase by 23%. In
    contrast, increasing reservoir volumes for planned power plants will have no significant
    impact on generation. The path to HPP resilience could entail a combination of
    diversifying the generation mix, installing generators with varying capacities,
    and incorporating adjustable orifices on reservoirs.

- abstract: This study estimates job creation from Costa Rica's transition to net-zero
    emissions by 2050, contrasting it with a business-as-usual scenario (BAU) using
    employment multipliers from Costa Rica’s input–output matrix. The model is soft-linked
    with a bottom-up technology‒rich regional model of the CLEW sectors in Costa Rica.
    A robust decision-making-inspired approach is taken to assess the effects of uncertainty
    on the estimations. The study addresses a literature gap in modeling subnational
    employment while accounting for long-term uncertainty and allows to identify economic
    activities affected by the transformation, so that policies regarding a just transition can
    be properly developed and stakeholders incentivized to take active participation
    in the process. Under baseline assumptions, a net-zero economy would have 135
    thousand more jobs by 2050 than the BAU, equivalent to 7% of the employed population
    in 2017. Energy-related jobs would triple by mid-21st century, and regions capitalizing
    on renewables would perceive the highest gain. When considering uncertainty, the
    net jobs range between 35‒750 thousand. Since net positive outcomes in terms of
    jobs are feasible, global governance should focus efforts on policies that enhance
    these.

- abstract: The Climate, Land, Energy and Water systems (CLEWs) approach guides the
    development of integrated assessments. The approach includes an analytical component
    that can be performed using simple accounting methods, soft-linking tools, incorporating
    cross-systems considerations in sectoral models, or using one modelling tool to
    represent CLEW systems. This paper describes how a CLEWs quantitative analysis
    can be performed using one single modelling tool, the Open Source Energy Modelling
    System (OSeMOSYS). Although OSeMOSYS was primarily developed for energy systems
    analysis, the tool’s functionality and flexibility allow for its application to
    CLEWs. A step-by-step explanation of how climate, land, energy, and water systems
    can be represented with OSeMOSYS, complemented with the interpretation of sets,
    parameters, and variables in the OSeMOSYS code, is provided. A hypothetical case
    serves as the basis for developing a modelling exercise that exemplifies the building
    of a CLEWs model in OSeMOSYS. System-centred scenario analysis is performed with
    the integrated model example to illustrate its application. The analysis of results
    shows how integrated insights can be derived from the quantitative exercise in
    the form of conflicts, trade-offs, opportunities, and synergies. In addition to
    the modelling exercise, using the OSeMOSYS-CLEWs example in teaching, training
    and open science is explored to support knowledge transfer and advancement in
    the field.

    land area, the impacts on water systems, which increases by approximately 222
    billion m 3 compared to the baseline, may be even more limiting for the Canadian
    context. While switchgrass biofuels can contribute low-carbon dispatchable electricity,

- abstract: The Water-Energy-Food (WEF) framework is widely used to address sustainability and
    resource management questions. However, many WEF methods miss engaging with stakeholders
    in the process. In this study, we introduce a stakeholder-driven and model-supported
    robust nexus decision-making framework. This methodology is exemplified by a case
    study in the Souss-Massa basin (SMB) which has significant importance for the
    agricultural sector in Morocco. However, the water scarcity exacerbated by climate
    change, overexploitation of groundwater and heavy use of fossil fuelsfor pumping
    is threatening the future of this fertile land. An integrated agriculture, water
    and energy model was developed to explore various potential solutions or scenarios
    such as desalination, wastewater reuse and improved water productivity. The analysis
    revealed that engaging with stakeholders and developing common robust nexus decision
    metrics is essential to establishing a shared and transparent approach to address
    the complicated nexus challenges. It also showed that no one solution can address
    all nexus challenges and highlighted the need for an integrated strategy that
    stimulates the contributions from different sectors. Finally, the transition from
    fossil fuel groundwater pumping to solar pumping is shown to be economically and
    environmentally viable.

- abstract: Africa's economic and population growth prospects are likely to increase
    energy and water demands. This quantitative study shows that energy decarbonisation
    pathways reduce water withdrawals (WWs) and water consumption (WC) relative to
    the baseline scenario. However, the more aggressive decarbonisation pathway (1.5
    °C) leads to higher overall WWs than the 2.0 °C scenario but lower WC levels by
    2065. By 2065, investments in low-carbon energy infrastructure increase annual
    WWs from 1% (52 bcm) in the 2.0 °C to 2% (85 bcm) in the 1.5 °C scenarios of total
    renewable water resources in Africa compared to 3% (159 bcm) in the baseline scenario
    with lower final energy demands in the mitigation scenarios. WC decreases from
    1.2 bcm in the 2.0 °C to 1 bcm in the 1.5 °C scenario, compared to 2.2 bcm in
    the baseline scenario by 2065, due to the lower water intensity of the low-carbon
    energy systems. To meet the 1.5 °C pathway, the energy sector requires a higher
    WW than the 2.0 °C scenario, both in total and per unit of final energy. Overall,
    these findings demonstrate the crucial role of integrated water-energy planning,
    and the need for joined-up carbon policy and water resources management for the
    continent to achieve climate-compatible growth.

- abstract: Population growth, urbanization and economic development drive the use
    of resources. Securing access to essential services such as energy, water, and
    food, while achieving sustainable development, require that policy and planning
    processes follow an integrated approach. The ‘Climate-, Land-, Energy- and Water-systems’
    (CLEWs) framework assists the exploration of interactions between (and within)
    CLEW systems via quantitative means. The approach was first introduced by the
    International Atomic Energy Agency to conduct an integrated systems analysis of
    a biofuel chain. The framework assists the exploration of interactions between
    (and within) CLEW systems via quantitative means. Its multi-institutional application
    to the case of Mauritius in 2012 initiated the deployment of the framework. A
    vast number of completed and ongoing applications of CLEWs span different spatial
    and temporal scales, discussing two or more resource interactions under different
    political contexts. Also, the studies vary in purpose. This shapes the methods
    that support CLEWs-type analyses. In this paper, we detail the main steps of the
    CLEWs framework in perspective to its application over the years. We summarise
    and compare key applications, both published in the scientific literature, as
    working papers and reports by international organizations. We discuss differences
    in terms of geographic scope, purpose, interactions represented, analytical approach
    and stakeholder involvement. In addition, we review other assessments, which contributed
    to the advancement of the CLEWs framework. The paper delivers recommendations
    for the future development of the framework, as well as keys to success in this
    type of evaluations.

    the OSeMOSYS tool and the CLEWs framework. The model enables the exploration of
    policy measures on the future development of the integrated resource system. Thanks
    to its relatively simple structure, it requires low computational resources allowing

- abstract: Approaches that integrate feedback between climate, land, energy and water
    (CLEW) have progressed significantly in scope and complexity. The so-called nexus
    approaches have shown their usefulness in assessing strategies to achieve the
    Sustainable Development Goals in the contexts of increasing demands, resource
    scarcity, and climate change. However, most nexus analyses omit some important
    inter-linkages that could actually be addressed. The omissions often stem from
    technical and practical considerations, but also from limited dissemination of
    new open-source frameworks incorporating recent advances. We review and present
    a set of models that can meet the needs of decision makers for analysis tools
    capable of addressing a broad range of nexus questions. Particular attention is
    given to model accessibility, usability and community support. The other objective
    of this review is to discuss research gaps, and critical needs and opportunities
    for further model development from a scientific viewpoint. We explore at different
    scales where and why some nexus interactions are most relevant. We find that both
    very small scale and global models tend to neglect some CLEW interactions, but
    for different reasons. The former rarely include climate impacts, which are often
    marginal at the local level, while the latter mostly lack some aspects because
    of the complexity of large full CLEW systems at the global level.

- abstract: Climate change impacts a natural and human system on the entire globe.
    Climate-related extreme weather such as drought, floods, and heat waves alters
    the ecosystems that society depends on. Climate, land, energy, and water systems
    (CLEWS) are a critical aspect of high importance on resource availability, distribution,
    and interconnection. The nexus provides a set of guidelines to South Africa that
    aims on creating a level playing field for all sectors while achieving the aims
    of the SDGs that are cross-sectoral and multilevel approaches to climate change.
    The nexus expressed three domains that included resources, governance, and security.
    It integrated a smart climate resilient with inclusion of the governance and involvement
    of the stakeholders. Recognition of spatial and sector interdependencies should
    inform policies, investment and institutional for enhancing nexus security and
    climate change towards making transition green carbon deals. The nexus offers
    an integrated approach that analyzes the trade-offs and synergies between the
    different sectors in order to maximize the efficiency of using the resources that
    adapt institutional and optimum policy arrangements. Economic transformation and
    creation of employment through green economy is one of the COP26 green deal agendas
    in curbing the carbon emissions (green house emission, industrial processes, fuel
    combustion, and fugitive emissions) as mitigation to climate change, which is
    cost-effective and economically efficient. The future climate change policy in
    the developing countries is likely to be both promoted by climate technology transfer
    and public-private cooperation (cross-sector partnership) through the technology
    mechanism of the nexus and inclusion of the gender.

    of the land-use and water sectors with the computational and data requirements
    to efficiently solve such a model. The aggregated clusters, combined together
    with energy system components, form an integrated resource planning structure.
    The modelling framework is underpinned by an open-source energy system modelling
    tool—OSeMOSYS—and uses publicly available data with global coverage. By doing
    so, the modelling framework allows for reproducible WEF nexus assessments. The
    approach is used to explore the inter-sectoral linkages between the energy, land-use,
    and water sectors of Viet Nam out to 2030. A validation of the clustering approach
    confirms that underlying trends actual crop yield data are preserved in the resultant
    clusters. Finally, changes in cultivated area of selected crops are observed and
    differences in levels of crop migration are identified.'

- abstract: Despite the excitement around the nexus between land, energy and water
    resource systems, policies enacted to govern and use these resources are still
    formulated in isolation, without considering the interdependencies. Using a Ugandan
    case study, we highlight the impact that one policy change in the energy system
    will have on other resource systems. We focus on deforestation, long term electricity
    supply planning, crop production, water consumption, land-use change and climate
    impacting greenhouse gas (GHG) trajectories. In this study, an open-source integrated
    modelling framework is used to map the ripple effects of a policy change related
    to reducing biomass consumption. We find that, despite the reduction in deforestation
    of woodlands and forests, the GHG emissions in the power sector are expected to
    increase in between 2040–2050, owing to higher fossil fuel usage. This policy
    change is also likely to increase the cost of electricity generation, which in
    turn affects the agricultural land types. There is an unforeseen shift from irrigated
    to rainfed type land due to higher electricity costs. With this integrated model
    setup for Uganda, we highlight the need for integrated policy planning that takes
    into consideration the interlinkages between the resource systems and cross propagation
    effects.

    2. Uganda, in addition to the transition in fuel usage (from biomass) and new
    policy mechanisms (investments andsubsidies), needs a change in societal thinking.
    For example, many urban dwellings, still use coal depsite access to electricity.
    This societal chaneg will support the transition greatly.

- abstract: (Background) There have been numerous studies that consider the nexus
    interactions between energy systems, land use, water use and climate adaptation
    and impacts. These studies have filled a gap in the literature to allow for more
    effective policymaking by considering the trade-offs between land use, energy
    infrastructure as well as the use of water for agriculture and providing energy
    services. Though these studies fill a significant gap in the modelling literature,
    we argue that more work is needed to effectively consider policy trade-offs between
    the 17 United Nations sustainable development goals (SDGs) to avoid missing important
    interactions.

- abstract: The North Western Sahara Aquifer System (NWSAS) is a vital groundwater
    source in a notably water-scarce region. However, impetuous agricultural expansion
    and poor resource management (e.g., over-irrigation, inefficient techniques) over
    the past decades have raised a number of challenges. In this exploratory study,
    we introduce an open access GIS-based model to help answer selected timely questions
    related to the agriculture, water and energy nexus in the region. First, the model
    uses spatial and tabular data to identify the location and extent of irrigated
    cropland. Then, it employs spatially explicit climatic datasets and mathematical
    formulation to estimate water and electricity requirements for groundwater irrigation
    in all identified locations. Finally, it evaluates selected supply options to
    meet the electricity demand and suggests the least-cost configuration in each
    location. Results indicate that full irrigation in the basin requires ~3.25 billion
    million m3 per year. This translates to ~730 GWh of electricity. Fossil fuels
    do provide the least-cost electricity supply option due to lower capital and subsidized
    operating costs. Hence, to improve the competitiveness of renewable technologies
    (RT) (i.e., solar), a support scheme to drop the capital cost of RTs is critically
    needed. Finally, moving towards drip irrigation can lead to ~47% of water abstraction
    savings in the NWSAS area.
